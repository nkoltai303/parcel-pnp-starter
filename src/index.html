        <h2>A Review of HTML</h2>
        
        <p>HTML is really a very simple scripting language. It consits of ordinary text, with elements that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters.
        <br>
        <br>
        The best part of HTML is thast once we know how to effectively use basic elements, we can look up how to use all of the others!</p>

    <h3><u>Headings</u></h3>
    <h1>This is a size "1" heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a size "2" heading</h2>
    <h3>This is a size "3" heading</h3>
    <h4>This is a size "4" heading</h4>
    <h5>This is a size "5" heading</h5>
    <h6>This is a size "6" heading</h6>

    <h3><u>Lists</u></h3>
    <p>Below is an example of a nested list, using both an ordered list and an unordered list:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>First</li>
            <li>Second</li>
            <li>Third</li>
            <ul>
                <li>3<sup><u>rd</u></sup> Place</li>
                <li>Tres</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Fourth</li>
        </ol>
    <hr>

    <h3><u>Links</u></h3>
    <p>Links are very useful, and help users to quickly navigate to new pages, both within and outside of the current website.
<br>
<br>    For instance, they can quickly direct users to <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_self">Google's Homepage.</a>
  
<br>
<br>
<a href="mailto:nkoltai@gmail.com"> Emails</a> can also easily be sent through the use of links.
<br>
<br>
<a target="_blank" href="#Top">They can even bring a user to a certain place within a page</a>
</p>

<h3><u>Images</u></h3>

<p>  Sometimes we want to go ahead and align puctures to the left of a line of text. Using the "align" attribute, with a value of "left" is a <br>
     perfect way to do this. You could also align the picture to the right of text by replacing the value in the "align" attribute to "right".</p>
